Previous studies predict news diffusion via peeking the social process (temporal structure) data in the initial stage, which is summarized as Peeking strategy. However, the combination of peeking strategies and machine learning algorithms has not been fully investigated. To predict cascade size and detect false news, we adopt Peeking strategy based on well-known machine learning algorithms. Our results show that Peeking strategy can effectively improve the accuracy of cascade size prediction. Meanwhile, we can peek into a smaller time window to achieve a high performance in predicting the cascade size compared with previous methods. Nevertheless, we find that Peeking strategy with network structures fails in significantly improving the performance of false news detection. Finally, we argue that cascade structure properties can aid in prediction of cascade size, but not for the false news detection.\nKeywords: News Diffusion, Tree-like Network, Peeking strategy, Cascade Structure\nSuggested Citation:\n Zhang, Yaotian., Shang, Keke., Feng, Mingming., Ran, Yijun., Wang, Cheng-Jun * (2022) Peeking Strategy for Online News Diffusion Prediction Via Machine Learning.

Drawing on threshold models, we reformulate the nonlinear threshold hypothesis of social influence. We test the threshold hypothesis of social influence with a large dataset of information diffusion on social media. There exists a bell-shaped relationship between social influence and diffusion size. However, the large network threshold, limited diffusion depth and intense bursts become the bottlenecks that constrain the diffusion size. The practice of viral marketing needs innovative strategies to increase information novelty and reduce the excessive network threshold. In all, this research extends threshold models of social influence and underlines the nonlinear nature of social influence in information diffusion.","tags":null,"title":"Jumping over the Network Threshold of Information Diffusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cheng-Jun Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Dec 05 2021, I present our research about the Future Employment of Media Industries on the All Media Forum organized by Fudan University.

PLoS ONE 14(11): e0225385. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0225385\n You can also find the manuscript of arXiv from this link https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04599.pdf.\nData Availability The data underlying the results presented in the study are available from IMDB website (www.imdb.com), IMSDB website (www.imsdb.com), and the Gutenberg Project (www.gutenberg.org). All the code and processed data are available from https://github.com/xuhuimin2017/storyshape/\nClaims The rich literature on gender stereotypes points out the assumptions to explore in identifying and quantifying stereotypical narrative structures, including\n   The emotional dependency of females on males. Men and women have different social imagines. Men are agentic, and women are communal [19,29,30]; men are active, whereas women are passive; men give, and women take in relationships [29–31]. These biased images of men and women lead to biased expectations in their relationships. Those who consider women less competent would tend to believe that they are fragile and sensitive and need to be protected by men [19,32]. Following this literature, we propose to test the emotional dependency of females on males [33];    Men act and women appear. The English novelist John Berger [34] used this quote to describe the male-female dichotomy. Considering the stereotypical role and traits of men, one would imagine men are more likely than women to be described using verbs;    Social endorsement of gender stereotypes. The social and cultural roots of gender stereotypes form social force against stereotype disconfirmation from people, action, or ideas [19]. In this sense, the stories that approve gender stereotypes will gain social approval themselves, whereas the stories against stereotypes will be ignored and disapproved. Our study will test this assumption by connecting the frame of stories with their social acceptance.     We firstly construct a vector representing the dimension of happy versus unhappy from pre-trained word vectors using Google News data [17]. The distance from this vector to other word vectors represents the “happiness score” of the corresponding words. The average of “happiness scores” over the timeline of stories quantifies their shape. Moreover, by controlling the window size to analyze only the words surrounding specific names, we can track the “happiness scores” of different characters. Using these techniques, we find that in the movie synopsis of Cinderella, the happiness of Ella (Cinderella) depends on Kit (Prince) but not vice versa. This finding supports the “Cinderella complex” [18], a narrative structure enhancing the stereotypical incompetence of women. Applying our analysis to 6,087 movie synopses, 1,109 movie scripts, and 7,226 books, we observe the vast existence of this narrative structure. Our review of the words surrounding characters unpack their stereotypical life packages; the lives of males are adventure-oriented, whereas the lives of females are romantic-relationship oriented. Finally, we reveal the social endorsement of gender stereotypes by identifying the association between the strength of gender stereotypes in movie synopses and the IMDB ratings to the analyzed movies.\n    Fig 1. The Cinderella complex. a, Visualizing the sentiment landscape of the movie synopsis of Cinderella as a skyline (a black outline is added to enhance the “skyline”metaphor visually). We show sentences in a vertical schema, colored by their “happiness score”—green for happy and red for unhappy and the transparency represents the scale of the scores. Filled squares (orange for Ella and blue for Kit) indicate the co-occurrence of Ella (Cinderella) and Kit (the Prince) in the same sentence. Hollow squares indicate where only one character appears: b, The happiness curves of Ella (orange) and Kit (blue). The grey dotted lines marks the sentences in which they co-occur, corresponding to the filled squares in Panel a. We fit the increase or decrease in happiness scores across successive co-occurrences with OLS regression (see Methods for more information). Thick lines show the estimates of regression.\nOur analysis of the words surrounding female and male characters shows that the lives of males are adventure-oriented, whereas the lives of females are romantic-relationship oriented. Finally, we demonstrate the social endorsement of gender stereotypes by showing that gender-stereotypical movies are voted more frequently and rated higher.\n","date":1573689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573689600,"objectID":"9739232b80ea6a06bb801be882d4fd7b","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/storytelling/","publishdate":"2019-11-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/storytelling/","section":"publication","summary":"Using the word embedding techniques, we reveal the constructed emotional dependency of female characters on male characters in stories.

Modeling SOS with agent-based models, the findings suggest that there is no guarantee of SOS with reference groups being brought back; the stable existence of SOS is contingent upon the comparative strength of mass media over reference groups; SOS is size-dependent upon reference groups and the population; the growth rate of SOS decreases over time.

Put together, all of these factors discussed above speed up the tide of computational communication research.\n二十一世纪是计算社会科学的时代。1998年邓肯·瓦茨关于小世界网络的模型和1999年阿尔伯特·巴拉巴西关于幂律和无标度网络的研究复兴了网络科学。一石激起千层浪，在学术领域产生了深远的影响。对于万维网上的人类行为的研究也形成了一个子领域，被称之为万维网科学(Web Science)；伴随着社交媒体等数字媒体的发展，社会网络分析开始受到前所未有的重视，社交网络上的信息流动网络研究也引起广泛的兴趣；与此同时，机器学习和数据科学取得了突飞猛进的发展，进一步加速了计算化的浪潮；在新闻传播产业当中，数据驱动的新闻生产、计算广告和媒体推荐系统开始成为席卷世界的潮流。面对海量的互联网数据、持续困扰人类的重大社会问题、崭新的理论视角、诱人的物理学模型，在世界大战中发展起来的新闻传播学研究会走向什么地方？这构成了困扰我们的时代问题，而计算传播学正是试图回应这一时代叩问的一种尝试。在大数据和人工智能时代，未来的计算社会科学家更需要训练问题意识、培养计算思维、增强数据挖掘和分析的能力，而这正是本书写作的一个重要目的。\n计算传播学将传播学研究置于数据和计算方法的坚固基础上。数据作为一种新的石油，解放了社会科学家对于理论的过度依赖。随着数字媒体的发展，人类社会积累的人类传播行为数据的规模日趋庞大，详尽地记录了社会发展和人类互动的各种细节。运用这些生动的人类传播行为数据，可以从更细的颗粒度、更大的样本规模上让我们捕捉社会的发展。毫无疑问，对于数据的挖掘依赖于人类的计算能力的提高，依赖于跨学科的研究方法和研究视角。我们人类传播行为的基因恰恰隐藏在互动性当中，但这种人类传播行为的互动性本身也使得传播过程充满了复杂性。网络科学为捕捉到纷繁复杂的人类互动提供了一个很好的视角。从数据出发，借助于计算方法和好的理论视角，就可以更好地刻画人类传播行为的模式和法则。\n目标读者  致力于进行“计算社会科学” 研究的本科生与研究生 准备开设《计算传播学》或《计算社会科学》课程的青年教师 对于定量传播学研究有基本了解 对于Python、R等软件仅初步了解 致力于日后进入相关数据科学领域工作的学生  本书特色  强调跨学科合作 （传播学、网络科学、计算机科学） 引用大量发表于Science、Nature、Proceedings of National Sciences (PNAS) 等国际顶级期刊的论文 附加主要Python程序代码  书籍网站 Slides和Code见：https://github.com/SocratesAcademy/ccrbook\n Python代码 教案 案例  导教班及教学研讨会  2019年 培训对象：利用本书作为核心教材的青年教师  如何购买？  上市时间：10月中下旬 售价：49.8元 京东、当当、亚马逊、卓越 （上市新书发布期间有一定折扣）  ","date":1539734400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539734400,"objectID":"a72a742e3c6fb1fa98008f5ab9a63704","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/ccr-book/","publishdate":"2018-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ccr-book/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction to Computational Communication (In Chinese 计算传播学导论) now available on [dangdang.com for pre-order!](http://product.dangdang.com/25581097.html) ","tags":null,"title":"计算传播学导论","type":"publication"},{"authors":["王成军"],"categories":null,"content":"引用: 王成军(2017).计算社会科学视野下的新闻学研究：挑战与机遇. 新闻大学,(04):26-32 （入选人大复印资料新闻与传播2017年第10期）\nJournalism Studies in the Perspective of Computational Social Science: Challenges and Opportunities WANG Cheng-Jun1\n[Abstract] Our society has entered the brand new era of computational social science. The new style of news production and the new paradigm of computational social science created both challenges and opportunities for the development of classic journalism research, which empower journalism research in the aspects of data, computational methods, network theory, and etc. This article aims to review the research on computational social science, especially its potential applications in journalism research. Finally, we offer a discussion on establishing the framework of computational communication research for better understanding of journalism research, with an emphasis on big questions, data, patterns, mechanisms, and general principles.

Out of these 4Ws, we have accumulated some knowledge about Who and What with traditional research methods (e.g., survey, experiment, and content analysis). However, due to the unavailability of time-stamped and geo-tagged data, little is known about the When (i.e., temporal) and Where (i.e., spatial) elements in human behavior. The increasing popularity of social media, the expanding capabilities of mobile devices, and the rapid advancement of computational methods provide social researchers a “social telescope” (Golder \u0026amp; Macy, 2014, Annual Review of Sociology) to examine the temporal and spatial characteristics of human behavior at different levels of granularities.\nThe proposed panel focuses on how to model the temporal and spatial features of human behavior with mobility data in a precise and parsimonious way. The interdisciplinary panelists will use empirical examples from their own studies and others’ research to demonstrate: (1) how we can conceptualize and/or operationalize temporal and spatial variables with different mobility datasets (e.g., mobile phone use and mobile apps use); (2) how we can develop empirical/mathematical models to capture and explain the temporal and spatial characteristics of human behavior; and (3) what are the theoretical and/or practical implications in the temporal and spatial analysis of mobility data. Moreover, the panelists will discuss some “critical” questions that have been voiced: What are major challenges communication researchers need to handle in analyzing mobility data? How can communication researchers work with researchers from other disciplines in mobility modeling? How can we deal with personal privacy, replicability, and other legal/ethical dilemmas?\nThe panel aims to help raise the awareness among communication scholars of opportunities and risks in the modelling of mobility data. Moreover, the panel will try to build an interdisciplinary dialogue on computational research between communication researchers, computer scientists, and research scientists from the industry.\nSub Unit： computational methods\nshort-bio Cheng-Jun Wang, Ph.D. He is currently an assistant research fellow in the School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University.

My name is Xinzhi Zhang, from baptist university of hong kong. The title of our presentation is analyzing mobile phone data with network science. I will briefly introduce the authors. Cheng-Jun Wang is currently an assistant research fellow in the School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University. And Xinzhi Zhang is currently a Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Journalism of Hong Kong Baptist University.\nComputational social science provides a new lens for our research of human communication behaviors. Especially, it emphasizes the perspective of network science and big data,including website logs and web-based experiment. Duncan Watts claims that “If handled appropriately, data about Internet-based communication and interactivity could revolutionize our understanding of collective human behaviour”. D. Watts, A twenty-first century science. Nature 445, 489 (2007).\nNetwork science is important for communication research because: Firstly, we live our life in networks; and complex is a mathematical representation of various social systems. More important, compared with the other computational methods, such as computer simulations, network science is more closely connected with the real world data.\nThe mobile phone widely used in contemporary society supplies many social data for our studies, including the calling \u0026amp; messaging data, the online surfing data, and the mobility data. Just as Michael Macy said, it’s been really transformative. The digital traces help understand individual and group behavior at unprecedented scales and levels of detail.\nFor the human mobility data, we have small-scale travel surveys before, it can be coupled with GPS loggers. The rapid rise and prevalence of digital media provides a lot of big data, including: Mobile hone data, social media data, smartcard data, taxi trips data, game data.\nMobile phone positioning is required when a user communicates with the network. When a user initiates a network connection event (e.g. a voice-call), the cellular network operator needs to know his/her location in order to determine the cell tower used to channel this event. In this way, the subsequent positions of the user can be well documented.\nWith the aid of the available data, researchers tried to study human mobility. For example, Brockman 2006 used the trajectories of dollar bills to study the dispersal of human, and they find that the distribution of length r can not be described as levy flights. Random processes with such a single-step distribution are known as Levy flights. Levy flights assumes that there is a power-law relationship between pr and r, the power exponent beta is usually smaller than 2. The simple Levy flight picture for dispersal is incomplete, since the dispersal is weak than expected. This is because the antagonistic interplay between scale-free displacements and waiting times: people might be less likely leave larger cities, and there are long periods of rest. Instead, they tried to describe human moblity as a continuous-time random walk, CTRW. The probability Wr(r,t) of having traversed a distance r at time t, where Lα,β is a universal scaling function that represents the characteristics of the process. According to ctrw model, t^(-α/β)*W(r, t) = Lα,β= (r/t^(α/β))**-gamma. Thus, they can fit the relationship between t^(-α/β)*W(r, t) and r/t^(α/β).\nGonzalez 2008 tried to study individual human mobility, and find that the distribution of both displacements and radius of gyration over all users is well approximated by a truncated power-law (see the left figures and the equations, here Rg is the radius of gyration for each user). However, after After rescaling the distance and the distribution with rg (main panel), the different curves collapse (see the right figure).\nSong 2010 further finds that the predictions of the ctrw models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. ” Give the number of distinct locations S(t) visited by a user is expected to follow the euation, S(t) ~ t^u, individuals has two choices, i) explore new locations. p_new = ro * s^(-gamma), and ii) preferential return to old locations, p_return = 1 – p_new\nThey observed that the distribution of time intervals of mobility follows a power law distribution, implies strong bursts. q stands for the probability of unknown locations, p(q) follows a normal distribution with a mean  = .7, indicating that we have no location update for about 70% of the hourly intervals, which masks the user’s real entropy S. The big nodes in the mobility networks are those old locations the individual preferentially return to.\nSong measure the entropy of each individual’s trajectory to understand the potential predictability in user mobility. They distinguished three kinds of entropy, i) the random entropy s_rand, ii) the temporal uncorrelated entropy, s_unc, and iii) the reall entropy S. Let ∏ (/paɪ/ ) denote the predictability, it measures how can a algorithm predict correctly. Panel a shows the distribution of three kinds of entropies; Panel b shows the distribution of the predictability. Panel C shows the relationship between ∏max and rg We can find that a 93% of potential predictability in Panel C.\nBrockmann and Helbing 2013 uses the global mobility network to study the arrival time of epidemics. The global mobility network is constructed from the worldwide air traffic between 4069 airports with 25,453 direct connections. Let pmn denote the fraction of travelers that leave node n and arrive at node m, we define the effective distance dnm from a node n to a connected node m as dnm = 1 – log pmn \u0026gt;= 1 . The effective distance between two undirectly connected nodes can be computed as the minimum value of the product of a series of dij between m and n. In this way, the arrival time of epidemics can be precisely predicted.\nSchich 2014 construct historical migration network using the birth-death location data of 120,211 individuals, which provide historical evidence for global patterns and local instabilities in human mobility dynamics.\nWe will talk in details about the study Titled Tracing the Attention of Moving Citizens. With the widespread use of mobile computing devices in contemporary society, our trajectories in the physical space and virtual world are increasingly closely connected. Using the anonymous smartphone data of 1×105 users in a major city of China, we study the interplay between online and offline human behaviors by constructing the mobility network (offline) and the attention network (online).\nWe can find strong correlations between offline and online behaviors.To systematically study the relationship between mobile users’ online surfing behaviors and offline mobility, we constructed mobility networks. Mobility network, nodes are physical locations and edges represent the movements between locations.Attention network, nodes are websites and edges represent the switch of users between websites\nWe primarily study their difference in terms of the network structure. Most complex networks are found to be small-world, but also many networks are fractal. For example, the internet is a small world. While the WWW is fractal. Fractals look the same on all scales = `scale-invariant’. There is a famous question about how long is the coastline of Norway. The answer depends on the length of your ruler. We can study the fractal patterns using the method of box covering. The box length is lb, and the number of boxes is nb, there is a power law relationship between them.\nUsing the box-covering method in networks, we can also calculate the box dimension db from the equation of nb(lb). Using the box-covering method, song renormalize the www network and find lb = 3, ie, within three steps, the www network can be transformed to a star network. We renormalize mobility network and attention network to compute db. There are 9899 nodes and 39,083 edges in the mobility network (Density = 7.9×10−4), and there are 16,476 nodes and 144,909 edges in the attention network (Density = 10.6 × 10−4). The diameter of the mobility network is 15, and the diameter of the attention network is only 10.\nWe find that (A) The number of boxes N(lB) is a power law function of box length lB in the attention network, and these two variables show an exponential relationship in the mobility network. (B) In the mobility network, the degree correlation (measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient Cor(Knn, k)) decreases from positive to negative when lB = 4, while the correlation remains negative in the attention network. Panel (C,D) show the transition of degree correlation in details. For the mobility network (C), the slope of data points is positive when lB ⩽ 3, and the slope turns negative when lB ⩾ 4. Meanwhile, the correlation is always negative in the attention network (D).\nThe spatial division manifests the location-based online behaviors. There are obvious spatial constrained patterns. We show the geographical distribution of three kinds of mobile Internet use behaviors. A. Shopping (red), B. Dating (blue), and C. Taxi-calling (orange). The spatial-constrained attachment is well developed in geometric network models. We use it to reproduce our findings. We use geometric network models of different linking dynamics to test our assumptions on the origins of the observed fractal and small-world patterns in individual behaviors. In all, we suggest that we find that they belong to two different classes: the mobility network is small-world, whereas the attention network is fractal. online and offline behavior could be governed by very different mechanisms.\nFinally, we would like to highlight some resources for human mobility research.

Targeting on this novel observation, we argue that task allocation is important in understanding team success. Our analysis reveals two types of tasks, one of low uncertainty and requires the commitment of a small team, or a small group of core members in teams of considerable size, the other of high uncertainty and takes the collective wisdom from a large pool of team members. The “parallel path” effect, which means that the probability of a challenging sub-task being solved by a “walk-in” user increases with the pool size, ensures benefits offset the cost of maintaining a big team. The lessons from the studied big teams, who have been trying to adapt to and survive from the dynamic online environment, provide valuable insights into the management practices of teams in general.

To investigate the rich-club effect in information diffusion on social media and its origins, we studied the mechanisms of information diffusion on the biggest microblog of China—Sina Weibo. The results demonstrated that there are obvious rich-club effects in both influential users and randomly sampled users; For the information diffusion within the rich-club, social selection, geographic proximity, and social influence were found to have significant influence, and the impact of social influence is overwhelmingly strong. The findings outline the landscape of information diffusion on Microblogs and the theoretical generalizations help us understand the hierarchical feature of rich-club phenomenon in information diffusion.","tags":null,"title":"The Landscape of Information Diffusion on Sina Weibo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lingfei Wu","Cheng-Jun Wang*"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1473379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1473379200,"objectID":"e022ec17ae32f910c215eb49f326612c","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/tracing-attention/","publishdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tracing-attention/","section":"publication","summary":"With the widespread use of mobile computing devices in contemporary society, our trajectories in the physical space and virtual world are increasingly closely connected. Using the anonymous smartphone data of $1 × 10^5$ users in a major city of China, we study the interplay between online and offline human behaviors by constructing the mobility network (offline) and the attention network (online). Using the network renormalization technique, we find that they belong to two different classes: the mobility network is small-world, whereas the attention network is fractal. We then divide the city into different areas based on the features of the mobility network discovered under renormalization. Interestingly, this spatial division manifests the location-based online behaviors, for example shopping, dating, and taxi-requesting. Finally, we offer a geometric network model to help us understand the relationship between small-world and fractal networks.","tags":null,"title":"Tracing the Attention of Moving Citizens","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cheng-Jun Wang","Lingfei Wu","Jiang Zhang","Marco A.

However, there is much left to understand about how this transition affects and is affected by the communication between parents and emerging adults. A survey conducted among 490 Hong Kong university students examined their self-disclosure to their parents as an interpersonal process centered on perceived parental responsiveness and the role of separation–individuation in this self-disclosure process. The results support the idea that perceived parental responsiveness mediates the link between self-disclosure and relationship quality in the context of parent–child relationships. Dysfunctional independence predicts less self-disclosure, perceptions of less parental responsiveness, and poorer parent–child relationship quality. Significant gender differences were found on dysfunctional independence, self-disclosure, perceived parental responsiveness, and parent–child relationship quality. Young women with dysfunctional dependence disclosed less positive information, perhaps driven by an excessive need for attention and care.","tags":null,"title":"Self-Disclosure to Parents in Emerging Adulthood","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yanto Chandra","L.

Drawing on extant research on the social activism and social change, empowerment and SE models, we explore, classify and validate the strategies used by 2,334 social entrepreneurs affiliated with the world’s largest SE support organization, Ashoka. The results of the topic modeling of the social entrepreneurs’ strategy profiles reveal that they employed a total of 39 change-making strategies that vary across resources (material versus symbolic strategies), specificity (general versus specific strategies), and mode of participation (mass versus elite participation strategies); they also vary across fields of practice and time. Finally, we identify six meta-SE strategies―a reduction from the 39 strategies―and identify four new meta-SE strategies (i.e., system reform, physical capital development, evidence-based practices, and prototyping) that have been overlooked in prior SE research. Our findings extend and deepen the research into SE strategies and offer a comprehensive model of SE strategies that advances theory, practice and policy making.","tags":null,"title":"Mining Social Entrepreneurship Strategies Using Topic Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["杜骏飞","曲飞帆","**王成军**"],"categories":null,"content":"杜骏飞, 曲飞帆, 王成军（2016）2015年中国新闻传播学论著评析. 新闻与传播研究，12：108-119\n","date":1457410521,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1457410521,"objectID":"c1ccfb2030eded00e588bba8a4ab6ad2","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/com-books2015/","publishdate":"2016-03-08T12:15:21+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/com-books2015/","section":"publication","summary":"对2015年出版的761部新闻传播学论著进行内容分析及评述，借助作者、商品简介、出版社、销量排行等结构化指标，可以窥探新闻传播学科的出版形势。中国新闻传播学界正在形成由科研院校为主导的学科论著出版格局，但政府干预和资本市场依然是主要出版动力，导致学术出版良莠不齐，为此应及时建立独立的学科论著评价机制和知识生产激励机制。","tags":null,"title":"2015年中国新闻传播学论著评析","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Cheng-Jun Wang**","Lingfei Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":145152e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":145152e4,"objectID":"604478a38914e74651a1a9a1224d3158","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/scaling-networks/","publishdate":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/scaling-networks/","section":"publication","summary":"We use clicks as a proxy of collective attention and construct networks to study the temporal dynamics of attention. In particular we collect the browsing records of millions of users on 1000 Web forums in two months. In the constructed networks, nodes are threads and edges represent the switch of users between threads in an hour. The investigated network properties include the number of threads $N$, the number of users $UV$, and the number of clicks, $PV$. We find scaling functions $PV \\sim UV^{\\theta_1}$, $PV \\sim N^{\\theta_3}$, and $UV \\sim N^{\\theta_2}$, in which the scaling exponents are always greater than 1. This means that (1) the studied networks maintain a self-similar flow structure in time, i.e., large networks are simply the scale-up versions of small networks; and (2) large networks are more “productive”, in the sense that an average user would generate more clicks in the larger systems. We propose a revised version of Zipf’s law to quantify the time-invariant flow structure of attention networks and relate it to the observed scaling properties. We also demonstrate the applied consequences of our research: forum-classification based on scaling properties.","tags":null,"title":"The scaling of attention networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["王成军"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1444018521,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1444018521,"objectID":"2ff880a688434dc52cadee9a9f3ca4e4","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/toutiao-logic/","publishdate":"2015-10-05T12:15:21+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/toutiao-logic/","section":"publication","summary":"随着今日头条的崛起,聚合媒体开始进入公众的视野。这类媒体都是基于数据挖掘技术,筛选和推荐新闻。它为用户推荐有价值的、个性化的信息,提供连接人与信息的新型服务,是国内移动互联网领域成长最快的产品服务之一。自从2012年3月创建以来,今日头条至今已经累计激活用户3.1亿,日活跃用户超过3000万。本文尝试从技术层面分析今日头条的传播机制和相关原理。","tags":null,"title":"“今日头条”的技术逻辑：网络爬虫+矩阵筛选","type":"publication"},{"authors":["王成军"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1423800216,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1423800216,"objectID":"477b0e8fc5540d2012d6b1086435122b","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/cc-intro/","publishdate":"2015-02-13T12:03:36+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cc-intro/","section":"publication","summary":"计算社会科学为传播学发展提供了新的动力。通过文本挖掘和引文网络分析,本文梳理了计算社会科学的相关文献,证实了计算社会科学发展过程中存在的两大研究脉络:多主体建模和网络科学,而网络科学的发展和互联网大数据的广泛使用真正促进了计算社会科学的发展。基于此,本文尝试从可计算化的视角定义了计算传播学,强调了人类传播行为的可计算性基础和对于大数据背后的模式、机制及普适原理的挖掘。同时,本文简要讨论了传播学可计算化的工具、目标及应用。 ","tags":null,"title":"计算传播学:作为计算社会科学的传播学","type":"publication"},{"authors":["祝建华","彭泰权","梁海","**王成军**","秦洁","陈鹤鑫"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1395289129,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1395289129,"objectID":"f2e157f8c88215292b958b4d375ef40d","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/ccs-application/","publishdate":"2014-03-20T12:18:49+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ccs-application/","section":"publication","summary":"本文旨在回顾和讨论新兴的计算社会科学在新闻传播研究中的应用。按照新闻传播研究中经典的5W模型,本文分别介绍了计算社会科学在谁(传播者),通过什么(渠道),对谁(受众),说了什么(内容),并产生了什么(效果)等五个领域的主要应用案例,并讨论了计算社会科学和网络大数据对这些研究领域的主要贡献和现存问题。 ","tags":null,"title":"计算社会科学在新闻传播研究中的应用","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Cheng-Jun Wang**","Pian-Pian Wang","Jonathan J.H.
